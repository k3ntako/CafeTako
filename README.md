# CafeTako
CafeTako is a website for reviewing and discovering cafes as workspaces. I noticed that not all Starbucks are created equally. Some are better suited for getting work done compared to others.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
```
  $ npm i
  $ bundle install
```
2. Create and migrate PostgreSQL database
```
  $ rake db:create
  $ rake db:migrate
```
3. For a sample location, run the following (OPTIONAL)
```
  $ rake db:seed
```
4. Start server
```
  $ rails s
```
5. Start webpacker
```
  $ npm run dev
```
6. Got to `localhost:3000` in your browser!
